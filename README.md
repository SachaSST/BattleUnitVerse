## Overview

Welcome to BattleUnitverse, a 2D platformer game set in a world where technology has reached its peak. Players dive into an adventure as "Voyagers of the Verse," equipped with BattleUnits, machines capable of traversing temporal fissures and exploring parallel worlds.

## Storyline

In a world where science has unlocked the secrets of temporal fissures connecting parallel universes, known as "Verses," players embark on a journey filled with discovery and danger. As scientists delve into the study of these Verses, they realize these fissures not only link different universes but also possess the power to influence history itself. Artifacts, technologies, and creatures from various epochs and dimensions begin to seep into the real world.

Players, as Voyageurs of the Verse, are trained to exploit these fissures using their BattleUnits to travel between universes. However, with the ability to manipulate Temporal Convergence at their fingertips, competition for control over the Verses intensifies. Factions emerge, each vying to manipulate these fissures for their own ends.

## Gameplay

### Modes

- **1v1 and 2v2 Battles**: Players engage in thrilling one-on-one or two-on-two battles where each side has three lives. As players take damage, they become increasingly vulnerable until they are ejected from the platform, losing a life.

- **Wave Mode**: Players face waves of enemies attacking portals. The goal is to protect the portals by defeating the monsters. Players can deploy walls or platforms strategically. Each player has double jumps and can throw flash bombs to gain an advantage.

### Objective

Players must combat adversaries from other universes to return them to their original reality. This crucial mission is vital for maintaining the integrity of Temporal Convergence, as the presence of outsiders in dimensions not their own threatens the space-time balance. Players face a difficult choice: protect Temporal Convergence to restore order or exploit the power of the Verses for personal gain, risking unforeseen consequences.
